Different 3D objects moving inside a sphere 

Imagine a hallow sphere at the center of the coordinate frame (0,0,0) . The walls of the sphere are rigid. The insides of the sphere contains a few 3D objects that are made of trianlgles, which are constently trying to escape from the clutches of the sphere, but bouces back again and again (randomly). These objects are rotating(randomly) and moving(randomly) within the boundry of the sphere.
